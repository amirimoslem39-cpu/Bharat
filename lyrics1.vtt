00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.600
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.000
A broken heart is all that's left

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.600
I'm still fixing all the cracks

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.200
Lost a couple of pieces when

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.900
I carried it, carried
it, carried it home

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.800
I'm afraid of all I am

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.600
My mind feels like a foreign land

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.500
Silence ringing inside my head

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.600
Please, carry me, carry
me, carry me home

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.400
I've spent all of the love I saved

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.000
We were always a losing game

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.200
Small-town boy in a big arcade

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.200
I got addicted to a losing game

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.300
Ooh, ooh

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.200
Ooh, ooh

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.800
All I know, all I know

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.100
Loving you is a losing game

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.400
How many pennies in the slot?

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.300
Giving us up didn't take a lot

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.200
I saw the end 'fore it begun

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.200
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.000
Ooh, ooh

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.700
Ooh, ooh

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.700
All I know, all I know

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.500
Loving you is a losing game

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.800
Ooh, ooh

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.100
Ooh, ooh

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.500
All I know, all I know

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.100
Loving you is a losing game

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.000
I don't need your games, game over

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.700
Get me off this roller-coaster

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.200
Ooh, ooh

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.800
Ooh, ooh

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.700
All I know, all I know

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.700
Loving you is a losing game

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.300
Ooh, ooh

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.400
Ooh, ooh

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.100
All I know, all I know

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.800
Loving you is a losing game

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.500
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:24.599
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:34.599
